  /*
   * Here is the rewriter flow.
   *
   * Expression resolver: replaces the queried expression columns with their
   * expression ASTs in the query AST.
   *
   * ColumnResolver : ColumnResolver finds all the columns in the query AST
   *
   * AliasReplacer: - Finds queried column to table alias. - Finds queried dim
   * attributes and queried measures. - Does queried field validation wrt
   * derived cubes, if all fields of queried cube cannot be queried together. -
   * Replaces all the columns in all expressions with tablealias.column
   *
   * DenormalizationResolver: Phase 1: Finds all the queried column references
   * if any.
   *
   * CandidateTableResolver: Phase 1: - Prune candidate fact tables if queried
   * dim attributes are not present. - Also Figures out if queried column is not
   * part of candidate table, but it is a denormalized field which can reached
   * through a reference - Finds all the candidate fact sets containing queried
   * measures. Prunes facts which do not contain any of the queried measures.
   *
   * JoinResolver : - Finds all the join chains for between tables queried.
   *
   * TimerangeResolver : - Finds all timeranges in the query and does validation
   * wrt the queried field's life and the range queried
   *
   * CandidateTableResolver: Phase 2: - Prunes candidates tables if required
   * join columns are not part of candidate tables - Required source
   * columns(join columns) for reaching a denormalized field, are not part of
   * candidate tables - Required denormalized fields are not part of refered
   * tables, there by all the candidates which are using denormalized fields.
   *
   * AggregateResolver : - If non default aggregate or no aggregate queried for
   * a measure, it prunes all aggregate facts from candidates. - Replaces
   * measures with default aggregates. if enabled
   *
   * GroupbyResolver : - Promotes select to groupby and groupby to select, if
   * enabled
   *
   * StorageTableResolver : - Resolves storages and partitions for all candidate
   * tables. Prunes candidates if not storages are available.
   *
   * Whenever a candidate fact is pruned (because of no storages, no default
   * aggregate and etc), the sets containing the fact are also pruned.
   *
   * LeastPartitionResolver and LightestFactResolver work on candidate fact sets
   * and considers sets with least number of partitions required and lightest
   * facts respectively.
   *
   * If LightestFact first flag is enabled, LightestFactResolver is applied
   * before StorageTableResolver.
   *
   * MaxCoveringFactResolver runs just after all candidate facts' partitions
   * are resolved. It then sees how much time range each fact set is able to cover
   * and finds the maximum coverable range. It then prunes all fact sets that
   * are covering less than that range. If fail on partial is true, then by the
   * time this resolver runs, all the candidate fact sets cover full range.
   * So there this resolver is a no-op. Same thing when fail on partial is false
   * and no fact set has any data. This is most useful when facts actually have
   * partial data. There it'll ensure the facts that are covering the maximum
   * time range will be picked.
   *
   *
   * Once all rewriters are done, finally picks up one of the available
   * candidate sets to answer the query, after all the resolvers are done. Once
   * the final candidate fact set is picked, if number of elements in the fact
   * set is one, the query written as with cube query ASTs. If the number of
   * fact sets is more, then query rewritten with MultifactHQLContext which
   * writes a join query with each fact query. A fact query contains only the
   * fields queried from that fact. The ASTs corresponding to the fact are AST
   * copied from original query and the expressions missing from this fact
   * removed.
