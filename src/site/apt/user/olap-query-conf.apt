|<<No.>>|<<Property Name>>|<<Default Value>>|<<Description>>|
*--+--+---+--+
|1|lens.cube.query.bridge.table.field.aggregator|collect_set|The field aggregator function to be used for aggregating fields from bridge tables. Would be used only when flattening is enabled. The value can be passed for each query. During typical deployments it would be passed for each driver, as the function could be different for each driver.|
*--+--+---+--+
|2|lens.cube.query.bridge.table.field.array.filter|array_contains|The array filter function to be used for filter on fields from bridge tables. Would be used only when flattening is enabled and not flattening early. The value can be passed for each query. During typical deployments it would be passed for each driver, as the function could be different for each driver. Signature of the filter getting passed here should be very similar to array_contains. i.e. array_contains(array, value) to return true if array contains value.|
*--+--+---+--+
|3|lens.cube.query.disable.aggregate.resolver|true|Tells whether to disable automatic resolution of aggregations for measures in a cube. To enable automatic resolution, this value should be false.|
*--+--+---+--+
|4|lens.cube.query.disable.auto.join|true|Tells whether to disable automatic resolution of join conditions between tables involved. To enable automatic resolution, this value should be false.|
*--+--+---+--+
|5|lens.cube.query.driver.supported.storages| |List of comma separated storage names that supported by a driver. If no value is specified, all storages are valid|
*--+--+---+--+
|6|lens.cube.query.enable.attrfields.add.distinct|true|When the query has only attribute fields projected from cube and the flag is set to true, distinct clause will be added for the projection so that no duplicate values will be projected. If flag is set to false, projection wont be changed, result might include duplicate values.|
*--+--+---+--+
|7|lens.cube.query.enable.flattening.bridge.tables|false|Flag specifies if fields selected have to be flattened or not, if they are coming from tables with many to many relationship in join. If false, field selection will be simple join and selecting the field. If true, the fields from bridge tables will be aggregated grouped by join key.|
*--+--+---+--+
|8|lens.cube.query.enable.storages.union|false|Sometimes One storage table doesn't contain all required partitions, and the query needs to be answered from two storage tables. Enabling this (make value = <true>) allows rewrite of such queries. If it's <false>, then such queries will fail in rewrite phase. The feature should only be enabled when all the aggregate functions used in the query (explicitly or implicitly picked from default aggregates of used measures) are transitive. Transitive aggregate functions are those that follow the following property:\ |
