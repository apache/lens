Compatibility in Apache Lens

  Apache Lens tries to offer backward compatibility across releases with respect to the following

  * <<lens-api>> module dependency :
  {{{http://lens.incubator.apache.org/apidocs/index.html} API for org.apache.lens.api.*}}

  * REST api provided : {{{http://lens.incubator.apache.org/rest.html} Published REST api}}

  * Configuration options provided at {{{../user/client-config.html} Client configuration}},
  {{{../user/olap-query-conf.html} OLAP query configuration}} and
  {{{../admin/config-server.html} Server configuration}}.

  * Deployment stack : Published at {{{../admin/deployment.html} Suggested deployment}}

  []


  For any changes proposed in <<lens-api>>, <<REST api>> and <<configuration options>>, Apache Lens community will do
  atleast one release with backward compatibility making current usage deprecated.

  If there are any incompatibilities with respect to the above in any release, the major version will be called out as
  incompatible with earlier version and tools/documentation will be provided to upgrade to newer version.

  The api <org.apache.lens.client.*> and <org.apache.lens.server.api.*>  are still evolving, once they are stable, they
  will be added to the above list.

  See {{{./release-history.html} all releases table}} for all release details, compatibility tools provided.
