*--+--+---+--+
|1|hive.metastore.batch.retrieve.max|100|Maximum number of objects (tables/partitions) can be retrieved from metastore in one batch. The higher the number, the less the number of round trips is needed to the Hive metastore server, but it may also cause higher memory requirement at the client side.|

*--+--+---+--+
|12|lens.query.add.insert.overwrite|true|Prefix query with insert overwrite clause if the query is persistent. User can disable if user gave the clause himself.|
*--+--+---+--+
|13|lens.query.cancel.on.timeout|true|Specifies whether to attempt cancellation of a query whose execution takes longer than the timeout value specified while submitting the query for execution. The default value is true.|
*--+--+---+--+
|14|lens.query.enable.mail.notify|false|When a query ends, whether to notify the submitter by mail or not.|
*--+--+---+--+
|15|lens.query.enable.metrics.per.query|false|Generates gauge metrics for each query to measure time taken with unique id appended for each query. Should be enabled only for performance measurements. Should not be enabled in day to day production environment.|
*--+--+---+--+
|16|lens.query.enable.persistent.resultset|false|Whether to enable persistent resultset for queries. When enabled, server will fetch results from driver, custom format them if any and store in a configured location. The file name of query output is queryhandle-id, with configured extensions|
*--+--+---+--+
|17|lens.query.enable.persistent.resultset.indriver|true|Whether the result should be persisted by driver. Currently only HiveDriver persists the results in a HDFS location.|
*--+--+---+--+
|18|lens.query.hdfs.output.path|hdfsout|The directory under the parent result directory, in which HiveDriver will persist the results, if persisting by driver is enabled. This directory should exist and should have world writable permissions sothat all users will be able put query outputs here.|
*--+--+---+--+
|19|lens.query.output.charset.encoding|UTF-8|The charset encoding for formatting query result. It supports all the encodings supported by java.io.OutputStreamWriter.|
*--+--+---+--+
|20|lens.query.output.compression.codec|org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.GzipCodec|The codec used to compress the query output, if compression is enabled|

*--+--+---+--+
|22|lens.query.output.file.extn|.csv|The extension name for the persisted query output file. If file is compressed, the extension from compression codec will be appended to this extension.|

*--+--+---+--+
|24|lens.query.output.formatter| |The query result output formatter for the query. If no value is specified, then org.apache.lens.lib.query.FileSerdeFormatter will be used to format in-memory result sets, org.apache.lens.lib.query.FilePersistentFormatter will be used to format driver persisted result sets.|
*--+--+---+--+
|25|lens.query.output.header| |The value of custom header that should be written, if any. If no value column names will be used as header.|
*--+--+---+--+

*--+--+---+--+
|27|lens.query.output.write.header|false|Whether to write header as part of query result formatting. When enabled the user given header will be added in case of driver persisted results, and column names chosen will be added as header for in-memory results.|
*--+--+---+--+
|28|lens.query.prefetch.inmemory.resultset|true|When set to true, specified number of rows of result set will be pre-fetched if the result set is of type InMemoryResultSet and query execution is not asynchronous i.e. query should be launched with operation as EXECUTE_WITH_TIMEOUT. Suggested usage of this property: It can be used by client to stream as well as persist results in server for queries that finish fast and produce results with fewer rows (should be less than number of rows pre-fetched).
