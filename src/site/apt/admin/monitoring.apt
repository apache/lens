  * Total number of successful queries;
  
  * Total number of finished queries;

  * Number of exceptions

  * Number of HTTP client error

  * Number of HTTP error

  * Number of HTTP server error

  * Number of HTTP unknown error

  * Number of HTTP request started

  * Number of HTTP requests finished

 Ganglia metrics can be enabled by configuring the parameters :
  <lens.server.enable.gangla.metrics>, <lens.server.metrics.ganglia.serverName>, <lens.server.metrics.ganglia.port>,
   <lens.server.metrics.reporting.period>.
  
* REST end points

  Lens server provides admin endpoint at <host>:<port>/admin. It provides
  end points for ping, metrics, threads and healthcheck.
  
  * ping : admin/ping will respond with pong, if server is up
  
  * metrics : admin/metrics will respond with all metrics in a text file, written in json
  
  * healthcheck : admin/healthcheck is not implemented yet.
  
  * threads : admin/threads will give a thread dump of the server

* Query Statistics:

  Lens Server can be configured to emit query related statistics to a hive table <QueryExecutionStatistics>.The statistics service can be configured by providing values to <lens.statistics.warehouse.dir> set to a HDFS location where your query statistics log file will be persisted, <lens.statistics.db> the database which will contain all statistics related tables and <lens.log.rollover.interval> time interval which service will be monitoring for rollover in log file.The statistics can be disabled by setting, <lens.server.statistics.store.class> to empty string. The statistics service works by monitoring for rollups of <query-stats.log> file by log4j and adds an appropriate partition based on the rolled over file. The statistics can be queried using Hive queries.
