Lens server components

  Lens server comes up with embedded http server. It offers services for
  session management, metastore and query. 
  
  Here is the diagram describing all the components:

* Lens services

** Session service

   Allows user to start a session, close a session,
   add/delete resources in session, set session level parameters.

** Metastore service

   Allows user to do crud on cubes, fact tables, dimension tables, partitions.
   Administrator would be managing the storages available. So, all the crud for
   storages will be done by administrator. See 
   {{{../resource_MetastoreResource.html#path__metastore_storages.html}Storages API}} and
   {{{../resource_MetastoreResource.html#path__metastore_storages_-storage-.html}Storage API}} for details.
   
      Metastore service talks to Hive metastore server.Hive metastore server end point
   has to be configured for lens server.

** Query service

   Allows user to launch query, monitor the query and get results. User can also look
   at history of his queries.
   
   Lens server allows pluggable execution drivers for running queries. Available
   execution engines are Hive and JDBC. For configuring Hive as an execution engine,
   administrator should configure the HiveServer2 end point. More details on configuring multiple drivers
   will be covered in {{{./config-server.html} configuration guide}}
   
* Authentication and authorization

   Currently no authentication and authorization is built in lens server
