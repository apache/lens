# Inculding lens-additional-errors.conf: Pluggable code in lens which is not shipped with lens distribution can
# define new errors in an additionalErrors array in lens-additional-errors.conf.
# lens-additional-errors.conf can be deployed via any debian. However, it should be available on lens server
# and lens-client class path. Lens client has has to be aware of error payload classes defined with errors in
# configuration files to unmarshall the error payloads propagated with errors.
# lens-additional-errors.conf is an optional file and it is not mandatory to be present in classpath.

# additionalErrors is initialized to an empty array. When lens-additional-errors.conf is not present on classpath, then
# this empty array will be used in substitution down in the file.

additionalErrors = []
include "lens-additional-errors.conf"

# Prepare errors array for Lens server and Lens client.
# Lens server and Lens client are only aware of errors array. They are not aware of any other array defined in
# error configuration files. Hence an errors array is prepared which is a concatenation of all other error arrays.
#
# Error object preferrence rule: If an error object with same error code is defined multiple times within same array
# or different arrays, then the error object defined later will completely override the object defined earlier.
# Two error objects are considered same when they have same error code. This is done to ensure that there is only one
# error configuration per error code.
